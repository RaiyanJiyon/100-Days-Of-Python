#time.sleep()

'''The time.sleep() function suspends the execution of the current thread for a specified number of seconds. This function can be used to pause the program for a certain period of time, allowing other parts of the program to run, or to synchronize the execution of multiple threads. Here's an example:

'''

import time

time.time()
print("Start")
time.sleep(5)
print("End")

'''As you can see, the function time.sleep() suspends the execution of the program for 2 seconds, allowing other parts of the program to run during that time.'''
