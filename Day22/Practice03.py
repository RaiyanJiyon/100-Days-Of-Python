# List Sorting:

# Implement a Python function that takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list with the strings sorted based on their lengths, in ascending order. If two strings have the same length, maintain their original order. For example, if the input list is ["apple", "banana", "kiwi", "orange", "grape"], the output should be ["kiwi", "grape", "apple", "banana", "orange"].
